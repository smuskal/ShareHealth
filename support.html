    </div>

    <h2>File Organization</h2>
    <p>All exports are automatically organized into year and month subfolders:</p>
    <pre>
/ExportFolder/
  /2024/
    /01/
      HealthMetrics-2024-01-01.csv
      HealthMetrics-2024-01-02.csv
    /02/
      HealthMetrics-2024-02-01.csv
  /faces/
    /2024/
      /01/
        Face-2024-01-15_143022.jpg
    </pre>

    <h2>Face Imagery Feature</h2>
    <p>Associate your face with your health exports so recipients can easily identify whose data they're viewing.</p>
    <ol>

        <li>When prompted, take a selfie</li>
        <li>Your photo will be saved to <code>faces/YYYY/MM/</code> subfolder</li>
        <li>The image is stored locally on your device</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Privacy Note:</strong> Your face photo is stored only on your device and is only shared when you explicitly export your health data.
    </div>

    <h2>Health Metrics Exported</h2>
    <p>ShareHealth exports 100+ health metrics including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>22.75</code> = 10:45 PM</li>
        <li><code>6.5</code> = 6:30 AM</li>

    </ol>

    <div class="tip">

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h3>Historical export seems to stop mid-way</h3>
    <p>Keep the app in the foreground during export. The screen stays awake automatically. After completion, tap "View Log" to see which days succeeded or failed.</p>

    <h3>Files not appearing in Dropbox</h3>
    <p>Files are written to Dropbox's local cache first, then uploaded to the cloud in the background. Check the Files app &rarr; Dropbox to see local files. Keep the Dropbox app open to speed up uploads.</p>

    <h3>No sleep data for older years</h3>
    <p>Native Apple sleep tracking started in September 2020 (iOS 14). Sleep data before that date requires third-party apps like Sleep Cycle or AutoSleep. Your CSVs will still export other metrics; sleep fields will simply be empty.</p>

    <h2>Common Questions</h2>

    <h3>What format is the health data exported in?</h3>
    <p>Health data is exported as a CSV (comma-separated values) file, which can be opened in Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers, or any spreadsheet application.</p>

    <h3>Where is my face photo stored?</h3>
    <p>Your face photo is stored locally on your device in the <code>faces/YYYY/MM/</code> subfolder. It is never uploaded to any server and is only included when you choose to export.</p>

    <h3>Can I export multiple days at once?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Use the "Historical Export" feature to export any date range. Each day creates a separate CSV file, organized by year and month.</p>

    <h3>How do I change my default export folder?</h3>
    <p>On the Export Health Data screen, tap "Change" next to the export location to select a new default folder.</p>

    <h3>What do the Bedtime and Wake Time numbers mean?</h3>
    <p>They are in decimal hours (24-hour format). For example, 22.5 means 10:30 PM, and 7.25 means 7:15 AM. This format is designed for data analysis and machine learning.</p>

    <div class="tip">
        <strong>Remember:</strong> ShareHealth requires Apple Health access to read and write health data. You can check this in your iPhone's Settings &rarr; Privacy & Security &rarr; Health.
